# @chordbook/tuner

A web-based library for pitch detection of stringed instruments. It uses the [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) to capture audio from the microphone, and uses the [pitchy](https://github.com/ianprime0509/pitchy) to detect the predominant pitch.

### Features

* âœ… Uses your devices microphone to detect the pitch of stringed instruments
* âœ… Filters noise from low and high frequencies outside the range of stringed instruments
* âœ… Does not try to detect when the volume is too low

## Installation

```console
npm install @chordbook/tuner
```

## Usage

```js
import { createTuner } from '@chordbook/tuner'

const tuner = createTuner({
  // The callback to call when a note is detected.
  onNote: note => {
    console.log('Note:', note)
  },

  // Here are some other settings you can fiddle with and their default values.
  // (let us know if you find values that work better).

  // The frequency of middle A. Defaults to 440Hz.
  a4: 440,

  // The minimum clarity threshold. Anything below this will be ignored
  clarityThreshold: 0.95,

  // The minimum volume threshold. -100 means 1/100th the volume of the loudest sound.
  minVolumeDecibels: -100,

  // The minimum and maximum frequencies to detect. To reduce noise, everything else is
  // filtered out using a lowpass and highpass filter.
  minFrequency: 73.42, // D2, drop D
  maxFrequency: 1084.0, // C6, highest note on the guitar in front of me

  // The size of buffer to use for frequency analysis, which maps to the `fftSize`:
  // https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AnalyserNode/fftSize
  bufferSize: 2048,

  // https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AnalyserNode/smoothingTimeConstant
  smoothingTimeConstant: 0.9,
})

// Request access to the microphone and begin pitch detection
tuner.start()

// Stop listening
tuner.stop()
```

When a pitch is clearly detected, the `onNote` callback is called with an object containing the following properties:

```js
{
  // The frequency of the detected note
  "frequency": 612.2498364209699,
  // The node name (e.g. "A", "C#")
  "name": "Dâ™¯",
  // The note number (0-89)
  "value": 75,
  // The number of cents the detected frequency is off from the nearest note
  "cents": -29,
  // The octave of the detected note
  "octave": 5,
  // The clarity of the detected note (0-1)
  "clarity": 0.9656978357299373
}
```
